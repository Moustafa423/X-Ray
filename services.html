The use of radiography has also varied, including what is known as panoramic radiograph, which is used in dentistry to photograph teeth. There is mammography, which is used in breast imaging for early detection of cancer, and all of these techniques work with the same idea, except that the devices are designed to serve the intended purpose. With the progress in the field of electronics and computers, photography has become digital and there is no need now to use films. Relying on the computer for photography added many advantages in dealing with images after taking them, such as improving the quality of images, increasing their clarity, and sending them to doctors via the Internet to obtain more than one opinion for diagnosis about complex matters</p>

                      <p>It was not limited to capturing still images of the human body only, but the video imaging technology using X-rays, known as fluoroscopy, has developed so that the doctor obtains a dynamic, moving visual image in which a continuous beam of X-rays is shed on the patient’s body after being injected with a high-density substance. It may occur to us that this may expose the patient to a large dose of X-rays, which may cause him a lot of damage. However, the use of the image intensified tube, which was mainly used in astronomical observatories, contributed to reducing the intensity of X-rays significantly to obtain a video depiction of what is happening inside the patient's body, especially the vessels and arteries, with a safe radiation dose.</p>

                      <p>Ultrasound devices use ultrasound waves with a frequency of more than 20 kilohertz, which are emitted by a special probe. Part of the waves are reflected back to the sensor and the rest penetrate into deeper layers and are reflected back to the sensor. The sensor, using the computer, calculates the distance between the sensor and the layer inside the body from which the waves are reflected. The relationship between the distance and the intensity of the reflected rays appears on the computer screen.
                        Ultrasound devices are among the safest devices because they do not require the use of any additional substances that enter the human body and do not result in any significant damage except that they raise the temperature of the fluids that are exposed to ultrasonic waves, and here comes the role of the doctor using the device and his skill in avoiding reaching this stage. Thus, ultrasound devices are suitable and safe for photographing pregnant women, fetuses and children

                        It is an imaging test for imaging different areas of the body, and it is the least dangerous imaging test in terms of exposure to radiation. This type of medical imaging is the best for imaging bones, especially long bones and calcified parts, as well as air wherever it is found in the body. During this technique, X-rays are used to image the human body from PA, AP or Lateral View. This means that the resulting image is an overlapping image of all structures crossed by the rays. One of the most important reasons for conducting an X-ray imaging test is to diagnose bone injuries and diseases, diagnose lung diseases, diagnose heart diseases and follow up their condition, diagnose digestive diseases, and although the test is little used to diagnose most diseases in the digestive system, it may help diagnose intestinal obstruction. It is a condition that requires immediate treatment or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. Mammography is the most widely used test for detecting and diagnosing tumours in the breast.

                      <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ever-evolving and most advanced imaging technology for medical diagnosis by producing high-quality images that help doctors diagnose and treat diseases. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to generate an image of the body's organs and tissues. The organs and tissues inside the body are examined and result in high-resolution images that help the doctor diagnose a wide range of diseases and health problems. Modern magnetic resonance imaging devices are able to produce tomographic images at the three levels mentioned in the CT scan, and they can also produce three-dimensional images, which are a generalization of two-dimensional images. The most important thing about this technology is that it does not use any type of ionizing radiation and therefore it is not associated with health risks, as it is not known that there are any health risks at the long level of exposure to a strong static magnetic field, but this matter is still a subject of controversy and scientific research. Magnetic resonance imaging is one of the most important imaging techniques used to diagnose diseases of the nervous system, such as aneurysms, eye and inner ear diseases, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, strokes and tumors. This technique is also used for diseases of the heart and blood vessels, where cardiologists use it to assess the size and function of the four chambers of the heart, the thickness and movements of the heart walls and the extent of the impact of heart attacks such as structural defects in the aorta such as aneurysm and aortic dissection, as well as fat deposits on the walls of blood vessels, which leads to blockage . It should be noted in this regard that the magnetic resonance imaging of the heart is characterized by the accuracy of examination and image, as modern techniques are available today that give clear images that are not provided by other diagnostic methods. A breast MRI may be used to find out more about breast tumors, especially in women who have a lump in breast tissue or are at high risk of developing the disease.
This technique is also used to diagnose several diseases that affect the internal organs of the body, such as tumors and injuries to the liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, uterus, ovaries, prostate and testicles. Orthopedic doctors take advantage of this technique to evaluate joint diseases such as arthritis of all kinds, injuries, accidents, spinal problems, and tumors of the bones and surrounding tissues.

                        <p>All the previous devices photograph the organs of the human body from the outside, and there is another section for diagnosis that depends on the introduction of endoscopes called the endoscope, which consists of a flexible tube containing a bundle of optical fibers that are inserted into the human body and look through it to the internal organs that are difficult to reach with x-rays such as the esophagus, stomach and upper part From the intestines, sinuses, colon, bladder and joints, the idea of its work is to send light in optical fibers, usually a laser beam to illuminate the place to be photographed, and at the outer end of the endoscope it is connected to a camera that shows what is happening inside the body on a television screen. The use of endoscopes in performing surgeries has spread, and it is increasing. For example, the gallbladder can be removed using the endoscope, as well as the fragmentation of stones

                        <p>Nuclear medicine is a section of general medical imaging in which radioactive isotopes are used to photograph and evaluate the functions of body organs. These radioactive isotopes are usually injected into the body intravenously, taken orally, or inhaled if we use radioactive gases; Today, nuclear medicine has become one of the indispensable specialties in the patient’s treatment plan in terms of diagnosis and treatment, and the aim of the activities is to learn about the latest scientific developments in this regard. It was called nuclear in relation to the nucleus of the atom, which is the source of radiation emitted by these radioactive materials. Nuclear imaging is described as the most important peaceful applications of nuclear physics and one of the most important accurate medical methods for diagnosing and treating a number of tumors and diseases, in addition to the possibility of detecting a number of pathological changes in a way that was not available in the past. As a result of certain chemical changes that contribute to the diagnosis of the disease in its early stages.
